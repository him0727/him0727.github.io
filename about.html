		Hello, this is Benny! You can find me via Email, Facebook and Linkedin.<br /><br />
		<strong>- Nobody</strong><br />
		I graduated from PolyU and currently working as a Cloud/DevOps Engineer at a bank.<br />
		My current focus is on AWS, Terraform, DevSecOps automation, Development practices and workflow, with some experience in GCP and Kubernetes. <br /><br />
		<strong>- Urbexer / Explorer</strong><br />
		I love travelling and visiting abandonded places (Urban Exploration - URBEX). 
		<blockquote>
			URBEX: short for Urban Exploration<br />
			It is the act of exploring places in a city you normally don't get to see or aren't allowed in, such as abandoned buildings or drains.<br />

		As an explorer, I have been to 40 countries, some of my favourite countries: 
		<span class="green-text text-lighten-1"><i>Germany, <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Flag_of_Ukraine.svg/1280px-Flag_of_Ukraine.svg.png" style="width:20;height:12px;" /> <strong><span style="background-color:#0057B8; color:#FFD700;">Ukr</span><span style="background-color:#FFD700; color:#0057B8;">aine</span></strong> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Flag_of_Ukraine.svg/1280px-Flag_of_Ukraine.svg.png" style="width:20;height:12px;" />, ALL Balkan countries...</i></span>.<br />
		As an urbexer, I have been to some unseen places and abandonments in the world, mainly located in Hong Kong.
		Unforgettable examples include <span class="green-text text-lighten-1"><i>Chernobyl/Pripyat, Ukraine</i></span> in 13/08/2016, 23 - 24/05/2018 and <span class="green-text text-lighten-1"><i>Buzludzha, Bulgaria</i></span> in 01/06/2017.<br /><br />
		<strong>- Coder</strong><br />
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming" target="blank">What is Competitive programming?</a><br /><br />
		I take LeetCode daily challenge almost every day, and constantly participate in annual programming competitions including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Code_Jam" target="blank">Meta (Facebook) Hacker Cup</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Hacker_Cup" target="blank">Google Code Jam (Discontinued)</a>, so far I can only advance to 2nd round (qual -> 1st -> 2nd) for these competitions. I mainly use C++ for it due to its efficiency, and sometimes use Python when dealing with big number because no integer overflow occurs.<br />
		I am a problem setter on SPOJ. You can see the algorithmic puzzels created by me and its solutions on <a href="playground/algohol">Algohol</a>, which is about data structure and algorithm. Why not have a visit and solve them!.<br /><br />
		Currently, I am using three Online Judge platforms:<br /> 
		<a href="https://leetcode.com/him0727/" target="_blank">Leetcode</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.spoj.com/users/him0727/" target="_blank">SPOJ</a> (less active)<!--<strong>(Rank 2 in Hong Kong)</strong>-->,
