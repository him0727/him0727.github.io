		Hello, this is HIM0727! You can find me via Email, Facebook and Linkedin.<br /><br />
		<strong>- Nobody</strong><br />
		I just graduated from PolyU and currently working in Geoinformatics (GIS) field.<br /><br />
		<strong>- Urbexer / Explorer</strong><br />
		I love travelling and visiting abandonded places (Urban Exploration - URBEX). 
		<blockquote>
			URBEX: short for Urban Exploration<br />
			It is the act of exploring places in a city you normally don't get to see or aren't allowed in, such as abandoned buildings or drains.<br />

		As an explorer, I have been to 31 countries, some of my favourite countries: 
		<span class="green-text text-lighten-1"><i>Germany, Ukraine, ALL Balkan countries...</i></span>.<br />
		As an urbexer, I have been to some unseen places and abandonments in the world, mainly located in Hong Kong.
		Unforgettable examples include <span class="green-text text-lighten-1"><i>Chernobyl/Pripyat, Ukraine</i></span> in 13/08/2016 and <span class="green-text text-lighten-1"><i>Buzludzha, Bulgaria</i></span> in 01/06/2017.<br /><br />
		<strong>- Coder</strong><br />
		Doing algorithm online judge (OJ) / Competitive programming (CP) is a good way to kill time and to improve my programming logic and problem-solving skill. Although I am not a CS student, I still can learn Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) and gain satisfaction from this mind sport.<br />
		Mostly, I use C++ due to its efficiency. I sometimes use Python when dealing with big number, because no overflow happens.<br />
		I created an Online Judge Solutions Classifier, you can <a href="playground/OJClassifier/index.html" target="_blank">have a visit</a>, or view all solutions on <a href="https://github.com/him0727/Online-Judge-Solutions" target="_blank">my Github Repo</a>.<br />
		Currently, I am active in two OJ platforms:<br /> 
		<a href="http://www.spoj.com/users/him0727/" target="_blank">SPOJ</a> <strong>(Rank 2 in Hong Kong)</strong>, 
		<a href="https://leetcode.com/him0727/" target="_blank">Leetcode</a>.
